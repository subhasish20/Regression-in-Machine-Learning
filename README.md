# 🔮 Regression in Machine Learning

Welcome to **Regression-in-Machine-Learning** 🚀 — a curated collection of notebooks, examples, and resources designed to help you understand and master **regression techniques** in machine learning. Whether you’re just starting out 📘 or leveling up your modeling skills ⚡, this repo is your go-to guide for predicting continuous outcomes with confidence.

## 🧠 What is Regression?

Regression is a **supervised learning** task where the goal is to predict **continuous numerical values** (e.g., house prices 💰, temperature 🌡️, stock trends 📈).  
In simple terms: it’s teaching a machine to **draw the best-fit line through the chaos** 📐 — so you can forecast what comes next.

## 📊 Example Workflow (Simple Regressor)

1. Load dataset (e.g., `housing.csv`)  
2. Preprocess features (handle missing values, scale if needed)  
3. Split into train/test sets  
4. Train model (e.g., Linear Regression)  
5. Evaluate using:  
   - ✅ **MSE** (Mean Squared Error)  
   - ✅ **RMSE** (Root Mean Squared Error)  
   - ✅ **MAE** (Mean Absolute Error)  
   - ✅ **R² Score** (Coefficient of Determination) 📈  
6. Visualize: actual vs predicted plots, residual plots 📉

---
